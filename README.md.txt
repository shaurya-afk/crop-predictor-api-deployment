# Crop Prediction App

## Overview
The **Crop Prediction App** is a mobile application designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in determining the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. This app integrates a machine learning model to provide accurate crop predictions.

## Features
- **Crop Suitability Prediction**: Predicts the best crop to grow based on user input.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly Android interface for seamless interaction.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model for predictions.
- **API Backend**: Flask-based API with CORS support for secure communication.

## Architecture
1. **Machine Learning Model**: The core of the prediction system, trained on agricultural datasets.
2. **Flask API**: Hosts the ML model, processes user input, and returns predictions.
3. **Android App**: Acts as the front-end, sending requests to the Flask API and displaying results.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Android (Kotlin/Java)
- **Backend**: Flask, CORS
- **Machine Learning**: Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: CSV/Database for training the ML model
- **Hosting**: Flask server hosted locally or on a cloud platform
